/*
Interleaving of two given strings with no common characters
_________________________________
Given three strings A, B and C. Write a function that 
checks whether C is an interleaving of A and B. 
It may be assumed that there is no common character 
between A and B (Please see this for an extended 
solution that handles common characters also), 
C is said to be interleaving A and B, 
if it contains all characters of A and B 
and order of all characters in individual 
strings is preserved. See previous post for examples.

Solution:
Pick each character of C one by one 
and match it with the first character in A. 
If it doesn’t match then match it with 
first character of B. If it doesn’t even 
match first character of B, then return false. 
If the character matches with first character of A, 
then repeat the above process from second character of C, 
second character of A and first character of B. 
If first character of C matches with the 
first character of B (and doesn’t match the 
first character of A), then repeat the above process 
from the second character of C, first character of A 
and second character of B. 

=====> If all characters of C 
match either with a character of A or a character of 
B and length of C is sum of lengths of A and B, 
then C is an interleaving A and B.
